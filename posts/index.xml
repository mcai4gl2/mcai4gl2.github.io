Bought this computer back in 2015 winter as it was on close down sale from Currys. I went in last day after work and it is on 50% off, so I paid 250 pounds and got it.
I would admit that I bought it more because of the discount rather than the spec. Only when I got home, I really looked into the spec.</description></item><item><title>My Raspberry Pi Setup</title><link>https://mcai4gl2.github.io/posts/pi-custom/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 11:11:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://mcai4gl2.github.io/posts/pi-custom/</guid><description>I have got my first Raspberry Pi 3 several years back and was using it as a cheap desktop for travelling. It was the first SBC board I got. It was lightly used and as I stop travel, it has been put on the side to collect dust for several years.
Earlier this year, I salvaged two old HDD hard drives when cleaning up old computer stuff. I bought an ORICO 2 bay hard drive enclosure to fit them.</description></item></channel></rss>
