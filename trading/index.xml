The market was down and a lot of sellings going on. Looking at SPY ETF prices from Nov 2021 to Jan 2022 (All prices are from Yahoo Finance):
Not only the prices went down, it has gone down below 20 day SMA, 50 day SMA, 100 day SMA and 200 day SMA very quickly within a few days. 200 day SMA is particularly important support level as it is usually used separate bull and bear market.</description></item></channel></rss>
