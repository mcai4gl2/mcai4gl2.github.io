It maybe due to the fact that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t order many dishes. Maybe it is just the loneness when seating down by myself. Maybe it is because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of things to watch on my phone. I have always prefer to cook myself at home or do takeaways. I even rarely do delivery until early this year during my two weeks' quarantine in Hongkong.</description></item></channel></rss>
